By choosing to share that information, you should understand that you may no longer be able to control how that information is used and that it may become publicly available (depending in part on your actions or the actions of others with whom you have shared the information). I am not responsible for any use or misuse of information you share.

By using the Application, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
